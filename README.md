### About Me

I'm a dedicated full-stack software engineer with proficiency in Golang, JavaScript (React, Vue), Python, SQL/Postgres, and AWS. My expertise spans front end, back end, and DevOps, demonstrated through successful planning, coding, and deployment of microservices for production-level software. I specialize in designing complex systems and ensuring intuitive user interfaces. As a collaborative team player, I excel in engineering, testing, and deploying robust APIs, with a focus on code quality through meticulous reviews. Complemented by ongoing academic pursuits, including a Bachelors Degree in Software Engineering from Arizona State University and completion of the Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp at Hack Reactor/Galvanize, I'm dedicated to advancing my skills in the dynamic field of software engineering.
